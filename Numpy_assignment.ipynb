        "# Purpose of NumPy:\n",
        "# 1. Efficient Array Operations: NumPy introduces the ndarray (n-dimensional array) object, which is much more efficient for handling large datasets than Python's built-in\n",
        "# lists.\n",
        "# 2. Mathematical and Statistical Functions: It provides a wide range of mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra functions optimized for fast computations.\n",
        "# 3. Multidimensional Arrays: While Python lists are limited to one-dimensional or simple nested structures, NumPy allows easy creation and manipulation of multi-dimensional arrays\n",
        "# (2D, 3D, etc.), which are essential for scientific computing.\n",
        "# Advantages of NumPy:\n",
        "# 1. Performance:\n",
        "# a) NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient and faster than Python lists due to their contiguous memory layout.\n",
        "# b) It is implemented in C, which makes it very fast for numerical operations.\n",
        "# c) Vectorization: NumPy allows element-wise operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) without explicit loops, which speeds up computations.\n",
